# Project Title

A project demonstrating smooth scrolling using LocomotiveScroll.js and animated image rendering with Framer Motion.

## Features

- **Smooth Scrolling:** Utilizes LocomotiveScroll.js to create a smooth, immersive scroll experience.
- **Image Rendering on Scroll:** Implements an animation in the Work component where images are rendered incrementally based on scroll percentage. As the user scrolls down:
  - 10% scroll: The first image is rendered.
  - 20% scroll: The second image is rendered, and so on.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **LocomotiveScroll.js:** A library for smooth scrolling and scroll-based interactions.
- **Framer Motion:** A powerful library for animations in React, used for animating the images in the Work component as the user scrolls.
